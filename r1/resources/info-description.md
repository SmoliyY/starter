# OpenAPI Specification

The goal of The OpenAPI Specification is to define a standard,
language-agnostic interface to REST APIs which allows both humans 
and computers to discover and understand the capabilities
of the service without access to source code, documentation, 
or through network traffic inspection. 

When properly defined via OpenAPI, a consumer can understand and interact 
with the remote service with a minimal amount of
implementation logic. 

Similar to what interfaces have done 
for lower-level programming, OpenAPI removes the
guesswork in calling the service.
